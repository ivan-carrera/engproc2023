# Computational Representation of Cellular Lines: A Text Mining Approach

This repository contains the code and related resources for the project focused on the computational representation of cellular lines using text mining techniques.

## Overview

The project aims to derive a computational representation of cellular lines by leveraging data from the Cellosaurus database and PubMed. The methodology involves text mining techniques, feature extraction, and the construction of a dendrogram to represent the relationships between various cell lines.

## Contents

- `data/`: Directory containing raw data files from Cellosaurus and PubMed.
- `dataret.ipynb`: Code for extracting data from the databases.
- `dataproc.ipynb`: Code for processing retrieved data and constructing the hierarchical representation of cell lines.
